C++ library for network services on modern x86-64 Linux.
Heavily inspired by python-gevent, state-threads, plan9, and go-lang.

boost.fcontext taken from boost.context 0.7.3
http_parser from https://github.com/ry/http-parser

TODO
----
C++0x support (use std::shared_ptr, and possibly mutex and thread)
Optimizations (memory pool for stacks, etc. lots of room for improvement here)
Thread-safe lightweight logging library like Google glog.
Better debugging support, need to be able to get backtrace for all coroutines.
More tests and documentation and examples
