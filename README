C++ library for network services on modern x86-64 Linux.
Heavily inspired and copied from python-gevent, state-threads, plan9, and go-lang.

http_parser from https://github.com/joyent/http-parser
glog-0.3.1 from http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/
stringencoders from http://code.google.com/p/stringencoders/

TODO
----
Optimizations (almost no profiling has been done, lots of room for improvement)
Better support for std::chrono all around (qlock/rendez)
qlock/rendez to use C++11 mutex/condition_variable api instead of plan9
More tests and documentation and examples
