[section:overview Overview]

__boost_context__ provides an abstraction of the execution state, e.g. it
maintains data like stack (with local variables), all registers and CPU flags,
stack pointer and instruction pointer - a instance of__context__ represents a
point in the applications execution path.

A __context__ decides explicitly when it suspends and allows another __context__
to run (execution control transfered).
The use of a stackful transfer mechanism enables a __context__ to suspend its
execution from within nested functions and continues from the exact point where
it was suspended, if it is resumed next time.

This allows multiple execution paths running on a single __thread__ using a sort
of cooperative multitasking (__threads__ provide preemptive multitasking).
A __context__ can only run on a single __thread__ at any point in time but may
be migrated between __threads__.

Because a context switch between threads requires system calls (switch to kernel)
it costs usally thousends of CPU cycles on x86 compared to a __context__ switch
with few hundreds of cycles. The kernel doesn't need to participate in the switch
between __context__ instances (no system calls incorporated). 

__boost_context__ is intented to be the basis for a higher abstractions like
__coroutines__ and __fibers__.

In order to use the classes and functions described here, you can either include
the specific headers specified by the descriptions of each class or function, or
include the master library header:

    #include <boost/context/all.hpp>

which includes all the other headers in turn.

All functions and classes are contained in the namespace __context_ns__.

[warning This library is ['not] an official Boost library]

__boost_context__ depends on __boost_move__.
